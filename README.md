  ## Description ##
  Budget Tracker is an application that allows users to track funds by adding and subtracting and showing them how many funds they have available. The application also puts the funds spent and added into a graph displayed on the screen. Most importantly the application works offline and when back online sends the information applied when offline to the database.
